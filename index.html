    For all three scatterplots, we chose this color scheme for a few reasons. Primarily, the green is a lighter color, and contrasts the black color of the axis. Moreover, it has a nice contrast with the background.<br>
    Also, the other colors used in the graphs (activated by the buttons) were chosen with similar reasoning in mind- the red and blue both contrast the axes and the backgronud fairly well.<br>
    Finally, the marks used in this visualization are the points/circles on the scatterplot, which indicate the actual data. The channels for this graph are the color of the circles/points.

    For this bar chart, we chose this color scheme for a few reasons. Primarily, the green is a lighter color, and contrasts the black color of the axis. Moreover, it has a nice contrast with the background.<br>
    Also, the other color used in the graph, yellow (activated by hover), was chosen with similar reasoning in mind- the yellow contrast the axes and the backgronud fairly well.<br>
    Finally, the marks used in this visualization are the bars of the bar chart, which indicate the actual data values. The channels for this chart are the vertical lengths and the horizontal positioning.

    For this stacked bar chart, we chose this color scheme for a few reasons. Primarily, the green, blue, and red are all lighter colors, and contrast the black color of the axis very well. Moreover, they have a nice contrast with the background.
    Finally, the marks used in this visualization are the bars/lines of the stacked bar chart, which indicate the actual data values. The channels for this chart are the vertical lengths, color and the vertical positioning.
